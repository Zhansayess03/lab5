	<b>Sport</b> pertains to any form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition">competitive</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity" >physical activity</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game</a> that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment" >entertainment</a> to spectators. Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team" >teams</a> or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing" >racing</a>, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a <i>match</i>) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-breaking_methods" >tie-breaking methods</a> to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament" >tournament</a> producing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion" >champion</a>. Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_league" >sports leagues</a> make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_season" >sports season</a>, followed in some cases by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs" ></a>.
</p>
<p>
	Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athleticism" >athleticism</a> or physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexterity" >dexterity</a>, with major competitions such as the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" >Olympic Games</a> admitting only sports meeting this definition. Other organisations, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe" >Council of Europe</a>, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_sport" >mind sports</a>. The International Olympic Committee (through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_IOC_Recognised_International_Sports_Federations">ARISF</a>) recognises both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess" >chess</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge">bridge</a> as <i>bona fide</i> sports, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportAccord" >SportAccord</a>, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts" >draughts</a> (checkers), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" >Go</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi" >xiangqi</a>, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.
</p>
<p>
	Sport is usually governed by a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_sport" >rules</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition" >customs</a>, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sport)" >goals</a> or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.
</p>
<p>
	Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism" >sport news</a>. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectator_sport" >spectator sport</a> drawing large crowds to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_venue" >sport venues</a>, and reaching wider audiences through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_of_sports_events" >broadcasting</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_betting" >Sport betting</a> is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

	According to A.T.

		<h2>Meaning and usage</h2><hr>
		<b>Etymology</b>
		<p>
			The word "sport" comes from the Old French desport meaning "leisure", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining".[8]<br>

			Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.[9] Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.[10] <br>
		</p>
<b>Nomenclature</b>
<p>The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses "sports" for both terms.<br>
</p>
<b>Definition</b><br>
<p>
<i>See also: Game ยง Definitions</i><br>
<p>
The International Olympic Committee recognises some board games as sports including chess.

Show jumping, an equestrian sport
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord, which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports, and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport.</p>

<p>SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:[1]</p>
<ul>
<li>have an element of competition</li>
<li>be in no way harmful to any living creature</li>
<li>not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football)</li>
<li>not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport.</li>
</ul>
They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or Go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport).[1]

The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.[11] Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.

There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as video games, also called esports (from "electronic sports"), especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to Council of Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2.i, "'Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.

<b>Competition</b>
<p>
100m race record holder Usain Bolt (in yellow, right) and other runners, Moscow, 2013.<br><br>
There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport, with almost all professional sports involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.[1]<br>

<br>Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.<br>

<br>In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days, although moves like this are often controversial.[13][14]<br>

<br>In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.
